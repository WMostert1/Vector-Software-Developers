\section{Background}
South Africa is currently the largest producer of macadamia nuts in the world. One of the main production and quality limiting factors is the incidence of stink bug damage. 
\\Accurate timing of chemical sprays rely on accurate scout data and economic threshold levels of the insect pests in an orchard. However, scouting for these pests has
a major shortfall, namely the accurate identification of pests, despite efforts to train growers and scouts by various means.\\
Area wide control of pests and diseases is a concept that has been considered, but with the lack of scout data from across and within growing regions it is impossible to make such recommendations. \\

\section{Vision}
An innovative approach to handling the management and acquisition of scout data is to develop a smartphone application that is able to identify specific hemipteran species by making use of the built-in camera of the smartphone. This application should ideally be able to make use of the smartphone’s built-in GPS to perform geotagging and uploading information to a central database.

	\subsection{BugScouting}
		The BugScouting module has the following functionality:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item It provides the functionality for a user to be able to enter data related to a scouting trip - entering data such as the number of trees scouted, the average number of bugs per tree and the different kind of bugs specified. After which a summary should be displayed.
			\item It provides the ability for a user to record the details related to spraying.
		\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Module Scope}
		The scope of the \textit{BugScouting} module is shown below:\\
		\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ScopeBugScouting}
		
		\subsubsection{Use Cases}
		The concrete use cases for the \textit{BugScouting} module follow:
		\paragraph{getBugInfo \dotfill [Priority - Medium]}

\section{Architectural Requirements}
	\subsection{Quality Requirements}
		\subsubsection{Maintainability}
			As a standard requirement for all projects, SAMBUG needs to be maintainable. This is especially due to the fact that the project has very high expansion potential. SUBTROP has shown interest in further maintaining the project after completion.
		\subsubsection{Scalability}
			Since the user base for the system will be comparatively small, scalability is not a great issue. The load on the system will not under any foreseeable circumstances be extremely high.
		\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
			Performance is a very important requirement for the system. The goal of the system is to provide an efficient service rendered. Users of the system will be subject to high pressure environments where time is an issue.
		\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability}
			Since users will be relying heavily on this system to make important business decisions the system must be available to be used at all times. As such, a reliable system is of paramount importance.
		\subsubsection{Security}
			As specified by the client, for the sake of reducing usage complexity of the system, the security may be relaxed in this case due to the fact that the users are generally not comfortable with using technological products.
		\subsubsection{Auditability}
			There is no specific auditability requirement for the system since there will be no business value in tracking user activity.
		\subsubsection{Testability}
			Every service offered by the system should be testable via:\\
			1. Unit tests\\
			2. Integration tests
		\subsubsection{Usability}
			Usability is the main quality requirement for the system. In order for the system to have any actual business value it should be easy to use and effective.
		\subsubsection{Deployability}
			The system must be deployable to any cloud hosted virtual machine or locally hosted server.
	\subsection{Architecture responsibilities}
	The architectural responsibilities of the system include providing infrastructure for the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A web access channel
			\item A mobile access channel
			\item Hosting for business logic and services offered by the system
			\item Relational database persistence
			\item Sending emails for recovering of accounts
		\end{itemize}
\section{Architectural Design}
	\subsection{Overview}
		A layered architecture will be used with the following layers:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Access Layer
					\begin{itemize}
						\item 
					\end{itemize}
				\item Services Layer
				\item Data Access Layer
			\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Infrastructure Layout}

	\subsection{Database Design}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ERD}	
	\subsection{Process Flow}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ProcessFlow}	
	\subsection{Technologies}
		\subsubsection{Mobile Application}
			\paragraph{Android Studio}
				We chose to use this development suite since it is the industry standard for Android app development. The IDE provides lots of code analysis with the tool named Lint. It also has a very good dynamic layout preview to design the interfaces for specific screen variations. Furthermore, we decided to develop the app natively instead of using a cross-platform alternative like Titanium because the client specified that only an Android app would be required and therefore it seems pointless to deal with hassles that may arise in cross-platform development.
		\subsubsection{Web Backend}
			\paragraph{.NET REST Services}
			\paragraph{SQL Server}
		\subsubsection{Web Frontend}
			\paragraph{Aurelia.io}
		\subsubsection{Builds}		
			\paragraph{TeamCity}
			\paragraph{Gradle}
				This build system is the standard for Android Studios and therefore it allows us to easily get apps built and running. Testing and debugging apps is made really simple using Gradle. It also allows us to perform incremental building. 
			\paragraph{MSBuild}
		\subsubsection{Testing}
			\paragraph{JUnit}
			\paragraph{NUnit}
